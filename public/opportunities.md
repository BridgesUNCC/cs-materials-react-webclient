## Analysis and Visualization of Educational Materials

### Contact

esaule@uncc.edu

### Description

CS Materials is a newly developed web application that enables instructors to  distribute their pedagogical materials (think all lecture, videos, assignments, exams of a class). One of the features of CS Materials is that it enables instructor to classify their pedagogical materials against nationally accepted curriculum standards in Computer Science. The system enables the instructor to perform various kinds of analysis on their class, for instance, ensuring that the assignments address topics that were covered in the lectures.

In this project, the student will help the team develop better interfaces for the system to facilitate the usage by instructors. The student will help develop new analyses and visualization to facilitate understanding the structure of a particular course or the relation between different courses. In more technical terms, the duties would be performing maintenance tasks on a react application front-end, a flask application back end, and SQL database. Data mining tasks and recommendations tasks would need to be developed. Visualizations are often built in D3. The student would work in a team.

### Skills

The only required skill is being a decent programmer and having worked with trees and graph data structures (such as covered in ITSC 2214).
Having worked on web applications, python, and javascript would be helpful but can be learned.
Being comfortable with git, and cloud systems would be helpful but can be learned.
