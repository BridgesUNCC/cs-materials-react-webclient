<h2><u>What is CS Materials? 
</u></h2>  <p>The <a href = "https://cs-materials.herokuapp.com/tutorialindex"> CS Materials</a> system has been developed as part of an  NSF
CyberTraining award, for generating and disseminating high quality, 
engaging learning materials to serve as a shared resource for
CS educators. The system provides instructors with the ability to
share, find, and adopt materials that align with national CS education
standards, embody evidence-based approaches for increased
student engagement and improved student outcomes, while maintaining course
rigor. The proposed system is developed to support mappings to multiple 
standards and understand their relationships; currently it supports the 
ACM 2013 CS curriculum guidelines (the latest that is available) and 
the IEEE/ACM TCPP guidelines for Parallel and Distributed Computing. See
the </u></h2> <a href = "https://cs-materials.herokuapp.com/tutorialindex"> </a>
website home page for more examples  and a webinar video on an introduction to
CS Materials and its capabilities and benefits for computing related educators.

<h2><u>What does CS Materials mean to you and your students? </u></h2>
</p>
The need to have high quality student centered courses that incorporate
learning  outcomes, use relevant pedagogies and engaging materials have 
put increasing amounts of pressure on instructors who are teaching
courses with high enrollments, especially in early CS courses.  CS Materials
provides a system that permits courses to be aligned to the latest
curriculum standards, and allow instructors to ensure alignment between 
different components of their course, for instance, if their lectures 
aligned to  exams. They also have the means to search for specific materials 
(lecture, or an assignment, or a video) that meet their learning outcomes, 
compare their course content against similar courses at 
other institutions, or within their own institution (multiple sections of 
the same course, course sequence inconsistencies or gaps, etc.).

<h2><u> Call for Participation </u></h2> <p>
We are  interested in partners who are willing to  
input their courses into CS Materials and benefit from its features
described above. The project team will provide full support and if needed,
meetings with the instructor to ease the learning curve.  
<b>Instructor stipends</b> are available to support  participants.</b>
After a course is input into CS Materials, the project team will help 
interpret  and analyze the participant's course content, including comparison
to other similar courses in CS Materials.
</p>

<h2><u> How much of a time commitment does inputting a course involve?</u></h2>
Typically a course requires 1 to 1.5 day of work. It depends to a large 
extent on the number of materials that make up the course. Each material can
be a lecture slide deck, video, assignment, project, reading materials, exam.
It is best to enter this as individual materials as this makes the analysis more meaningful. The initial materials typically take the longest time, but once the classification guidelines become more familiar to the instructor, the process can get a lot faster.
